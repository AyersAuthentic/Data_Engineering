# Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
This project uses NoSQL data modeling skills with Apache Cassandra to complete and ETL pipline using Python. Data is modeled by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. An ETL pipline is created and used to transfer data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamline CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra Tables.
