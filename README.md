## Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres
This project applies data modeling skills with Postgres and to build an ETL pipeline using Python. Fact and dimension tables are defined for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and an ETL pipeline is writen that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Project 2: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
This project uses NoSQL data modeling skills with Apache Cassandra to complete and ETL pipline using Python. Data is modeled by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. An ETL pipline is created and used to transfer data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamline CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra Tables.
